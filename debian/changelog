calligra (1:2.3.73+git20110823.f222ef8-0r1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  TODO: think about the following packages:
    - kformula - fold in calligra-libs? rename to eg calligra-formulashape?
    - krita-dev - remove or split from calligra-dev?
    - kplato - provide transitional package (once upstream fully renames it to "plan")?
